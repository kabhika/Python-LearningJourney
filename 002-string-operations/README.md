# String Operations

**Date:** December 2024

## What I Learned
- f-strings for embedding variables directly in strings
- The `.replace()` method for substituting text
- String concatenation with the `+` operator
- The `.format()` method as an alternative to f-strings
- Using `in` operator to check if a substring exists
- String comparison with `==` and `!=`
- Multiplying strings to repeat them (e.g., `'-' * 50`)

## Concepts Covered
- String formatting (multiple methods)
- String methods
- Membership operators
- Comparison operators with strings
- Multi-line strings with triple quotes

## How to Run
```bash
python string_operations.py
```
