# Python Operators Reference

**Date:** December 2024

## What I Learned
- All arithmetic operators in Python
- Comparison operators and their return values
- List concatenation with `+`
- Membership testing with `in`
- Nested lists and checking membership

## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Name | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3 = 8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `5 - 3 = 2` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `5 * 3 = 15` |
| `/` | Division | `5 / 3 = 1.67` |
| `//` | Floor Division | `5 // 3 = 1` |
| `%` | Modulo | `5 % 3 = 2` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `5 ** 3 = 125` |

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Name | Returns |
|----------|------|---------|
| `>` | Greater than | True/False |
| `<` | Less than | True/False |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | True/False |
| `<=` | Less or equal | True/False |
| `==` | Equal to | True/False |
| `!=` | Not equal to | True/False |

## List Operators
| Operator | Name | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| `+` | Concatenation | `[1,2] + [3,4] = [1,2,3,4]` |
| `in` | Membership | `2 in [1,2,3] = True` |
| `==` | Equality | `[1,2] == [1,2] = True` |

## How to Run
```bash
python operators_reference.py
```

## Notes
This file serves as a quick reference for Python operators. Run it anytime you need to remind yourself how an operator works.
