# Python Learning Journey

A chronological record of my Python learning progress, documenting projects from beginner to more advanced concepts.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio and learning journal as I transition into AI Engineering. Each folder contains a complete mini-project with working code and documentation of what I learned.

## Projects

| # | Project | Key Concepts |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 001 | [Hello World](./001-hello-world/) | print(), variables, data types |
| 002 | [String Operations](./002-string-operations/) | f-strings, replace(), string methods |
| 003 | [Calculator (Basic)](./003-calculator-basic/) | input(), if/elif/else, arithmetic |
| 004 | [Calculator (Match)](./004-calculator-match/) | match/case (Python 3.10+) |
| 005 | [BMI Calculator](./005-bmi-calculator/) | formulas, conditionals, formatting |
| 006 | [Bill Splitter](./006-bill-split-calculator/) | percentage calculations |
| 007 | [Time Converter](./007-time-converter/) | floor division, modulo, while loops |
| 008 | [Grade Calculator](./008-marks-grade-calculator/) | multi-branch conditionals |
| 009 | [Guessing Game](./009-number-guessing-game/) | random module, game loops |
| 010 | [Backpack Adventure](./010-backpack-adventure/) | list methods (append, extend, pop, etc.) |
| 011 | [Rectangle Calculator](./011-rectangle-calculator/) | geometry formulas |
| 012 | [Divisibility Checker](./012-divisibility-checker/) | modulo, even/odd checking |
| 013 | [Operators Reference](./013-operators-reference/) | arithmetic, comparison, list operators |

## Skills Progression

**Week 1-2 Focus:**
- Basic syntax and data types
- User input and output
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Basic arithmetic and string operations
- Lists and list methods
- While loops
- Importing modules

## How to Use This Repository

Each project folder contains:
- A Python file (`.py`) with working, runnable code

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kabhika/Python-LearningJourney.git

# Navigate to any project
cd Python-LearningJourney/005-bmi-calculator

# Run the project
python bmi_calculator.py
```

## Tools Used
- Python 3.12+
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
