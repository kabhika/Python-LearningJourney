# Calculator with Match/Case

**Date:** December 2024

## What I Learned
- Python 3.10+ `match`/`case` statement (structural pattern matching)
- The `_` wildcard pattern as a default case
- Checking for `None` with `is not None`
- Comparing `if/elif` vs `match/case` approaches

## Concepts Covered
- Pattern matching (Python 3.10+)
- Wildcard patterns
- None checking
- Code organization alternatives

## How to Run
```bash
python calculator_match.py
```

**Note:** Requires Python 3.10 or later for match/case syntax.

## Comparison with if/elif
The `match/case` statement provides cleaner syntax for multiple conditions compared to chained `if/elif` statements, especially when matching against specific values.
